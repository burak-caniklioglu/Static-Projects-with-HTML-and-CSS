            <span>13 Important Things Babies are Trying to Tell You</span>
        </div>
    </div>
        
    <div class="sec par-1">
        <p>Every parent knows the first year with the baby is both challenging and exciting. Your baby cries all the time, grabs their ears, and you have no idea what any of this means!</p>
        <p>Luckily, some experts have decoded this unique baby language and I’m here to share the clues you’ll need to figure out what your little bundle of joy is trying to say.</p>
        <p>During the first four months of life, crying is the main way babies express their needs.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="img img-2"></div>
    <div class="sec section-2">
        <h1>7 Types of Cries</h1>
        <h2>1. Calling Cry</h2>
        <p>Ever heard your baby cry for about 5 or 6 seconds, and then pause forthe next 20 seconds?</p>
        <p>They are not watching a commercial. That’s a calling cry!</p>
        <p>This means that your baby has been alone for a while and nowdesperately needs your attention. If you don’t respond right away,you’ll hear this fascinating cycle of crying a couple more times.</p>
        <p>So, pick your baby up and give them all the loving they need!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="img img-3"></div>
    <div class="sec section-3">
        <h2>2. Hunger Cry</h2>
        <p>This type of cry is very similar to the calling cry with one little catch. If you don’t get in there right away, the crying becomes hysterical quickly.</p>
        <p>Your baby may also start rotating their head and making smacking sounds with their mouth. This is just a clear sign that it’s time to feed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="img img-4"></div>
    <div class="sec section-4">
        <h2>3. Pain Cry</h2>
        <p>If you hear a pain cry once, you’ll never confuse it with any of the others.</p>
        <p>This crying is flat and constant. But small hysterical outbursts mean the pain is increasing and you should call the doctor as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>This type of crying is also very loud unless your baby isn’t strong enough to make loud noises.</p>
    </div>
    

    <div class="img img-5"></div>
    <div class="sec section-5">
        <h2>4. Physiological Cry</h2>
        <p>Babies deal with all kinds of bodily functions like us, from having gas to peeing and pooping. And these can cause them more discomfort than
            you think!</p>
        <p>Thankfully, babies usually let you know right away by whining and squeaking as they cry.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="img img-6"></div>
    <div class="sec section-6">
        <h2>5. Sleep Cry</h2>
        <p>Sleep is another problem for babies. Sometimes they just can’t!</p>
        <p>I can relate! You know that old saying “I slept like a baby”, meaning I slept calm and peaceful all night long.</p>
        <p>In this case, their crying sounds like an offended and smooth whining, followed by loads of yawning. Sleepy babies also tend to rub their eyes
            and ears, so you can look out for these red flags as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="img img-7" ></div>
    <div class="sec section-7">
        <h2>6. Discomfort Cry</h2>
        <p>This crying sounds very irritated and often comes together with fidgeting.</p>
        <p>Your baby can also flail their arms and legs and arch their backs. This usually means time to check their diaper or change their clothes.</p>
        <p>They may either be too hot or too cold.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="img img-8"></div>
    <div class="sec section-8">
        <h2>7. Bored Cry</h2>
        <p>This one is extremely common. Your baby cries, you try doing everything you can but still can’t figure out what’s wrong.</p>
        <p>Easy, your baby is simply frustrated or bored!</p>
        <p>Take them for a walk outside or around the house. A simple environmental change can stop the crying quickly.</p>
        <p>Okay, so now that you got the different crying scenarios down, it’s time to talk about the other sounds your baby makes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="img img-9"></div>
    <div class="sec section-9">
        <h1>Baby Movements        </h1>
        <p>Small babies have their own body language that can help you detect their needs and moods.</p>
        <p>Let’s take a look:</p>
        <h2>8. Arching their Backs</h2>
        <p>Parents know that babies under 2 months old arch their backs a lot. In most cases, it’s just a typical response to pain or colic but there are a couple of exceptions to this rule.</p>
        <p>If your baby arches their back during eating, it’s a sign of reflux, after eating it means they’re full. And if your baby has passed the 2-month old mark but still does it, no need to worry they’re simply tired or in a bad mood.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="img img-10"></div>
    <div class="sec section 10">
        <h2>9. Rotating Their Head</h2>
        <p>This is your baby’s way of calming down. You usually see it when they’re about to fall asleep or hang out with people they don’t know yet.</p>
        <p>The good news is that you can help your baby. Just gently rub their back and they’ll instantly relax.</p>
    </div>

    <div  class="img img-11"></div>
    <div class="sec section-11">
        <h2>10. Grabbing Their Ears</h2>
        <p>This may look pretty scary but it’s completely natural your baby is simply exploring their body!</p>
        <p>However, if ear rubbing is followed by intense crying, you should definitely visit the doctor to find the source of the problem.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="img img-12"></div>
    <div class="sec section-12">
        <h2>11. Clenching Their Fists</h2>
        <p>Fist or no fist shows how hungry your baby is. A perfectly relaxed hand means that they’re full, while a strong fist shows that they need baby food right this minute.</p>
        <p>Noticing this little detail in time can help you prevent the hungry crying and save you tons of time and stress!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="img img-13"></div>
    <div class="sec section-13">
        <h2>12. Lifting Their Legs</h2>
        <p>During the first months of your baby’s life, colic and tummy pain are almost inevitable.</p>
        <p>Your baby tries to cope with it on its own by lifting its legs to ease those unpleasant sensations. But any additional help from you is totally welcome, tummy rubs are awesome!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="img img-14"></div>
    <div class="sec section-14">
        <h2>13. Jerking Their Arms</h2>
        <p>Loud sounds, bright lights, and sudden wake-ups provoke the startle reflex in little babies.</p>
        <p>As a result, they jerk their arms out of fear. In this case, your job is to comfort your baby and make sure that they’re alright.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="img img-15"></div>
    <div class="sec section-15">
        <p>That’s everything you need to know to read your baby’s mind!</p>
        <p>Pediatricians recommend parents talk to their babies as often as possible. Show them all the things around them, explain how they work, or tell cool stories, even if you feel like they don’t understand you.</p>
        <p>This type of constant communication will help them develop their own individual sounds and gestures to express their needs better.</p>
